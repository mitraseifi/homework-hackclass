first question: "how to make a hidden directory and how to show it on command line"
answer1-1: to hide a directory if we are in the corrent address of file, we can use "attrib "foldername" or "filename" +h
 to make it unhide again we can use "attrib "foldername" or "filename" -h
to show the list of hidden file: we can use ls -a
question2: how to create multiple nested directory
answer2-1: we can use "mkdir -p parentfolder/child1/chide2/child3" etc
